## ❓ FAQ

### Is this official from Zoho?
No, Mail Checker for Zoho is an independent third-party browser extension for Zoho Mail users.

### Which Zoho regions are supported?
We support all Zoho regions including .com, .in, .eu, .com.au, .jp, and more.

### Is my data safe?
Yes! We use OAuth 2.0 authentication and only store the minimum data required (Zoho Account ID and refresh token). Your email content is never accessed or stored.

### Why do I need to connect a backend?
The extension uses a secure backend to handle OAuth token refresh. This keeps your credentials safe and enables the extension to work reliably.

### How often does it check for new mail?
By default, the extension checks every 60 seconds. You can adjust this in settings.
